# About Me 

I'm a first-year PhD student studying at Harvard. I work with [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/research).

I'm particularly interested in distributed systems and security. 
More specifically, designing sytems which can democratize both control and security. 

When I'm not in the lab you can find me reading or playing the piano.
